Security Improvisation in Image using Steganography and Encryption\

The live demo is available at - \

This repository also includes individual functionalities, "Image Encryption" and "Steganography" provided as separated webpages through individually named folders which can be 
viewed and edited on Codepen.io (links are provided). \

The three layered security mechanism is developed as a Web Application - ‘Private’ using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Application requires an image as input from the user which is 
then encrypted using AES encryption technique. We here try to provide an extra layer of security by hiding this encrypted original secret image behind a cover image using
steganography. Now, this Cover-image (carrying the information of our original secret image) is again encrypted and is available for download after being processed.
